## Reflection on My Experience
This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of Git and GitHub. Initially, I faced challenges with Git commands and the intricacies of managing branches. However, by committing regularly and using descriptive messages, I was able to track changes effectively. I learned how to resolve conflicts that arose when merging branches and gained confidence in using Git as a version control system. Overall, this experience has shown me the importance of version control in collaborative environments and has motivated me to further improve my skills in data science engineering.
